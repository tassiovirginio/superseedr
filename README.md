```bash
superseedr
```
### ⌨️ Key Controls
| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `m` | **Open full manual / help** |
| `Q` | Quit |
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Navigate |
| `c` | Configure Settings |

> [!TIP]  
> Add torrents by clicking magnet links in your browser or opening .torrent files.
> Copying and pasting (ctrl + v) magnet links or paths to torrent files will also work.

### Shared Config Launcher Setup

If you use shared mode and want installed browser or OS magnet launches to keep
working even when they do not inherit your shell environment, persist the shared
root once:

```bash
superseedr set-shared-config "/path/to/seedbox"
superseedr show-shared-config
superseedr set-host-id "desktop-a"
superseedr show-host-id
```

Clear it later with:

```bash
superseedr clear-shared-config
superseedr clear-host-id
```

Startup precedence is:

1. `SUPERSEEDR_SHARED_CONFIG_DIR`
2. persisted launcher shared config
3. normal mode

Host id precedence is:

1. `SUPERSEEDR_SHARED_HOST_ID`
2. persisted launcher host id
3. hostname fallback

You can also convert an existing local config:

```bash
superseedr to-shared "/path/to/seedbox"
superseedr to-standalone
```

You can pass either the shared mount root or an explicit
`/path/to/seedbox/superseedr-config`. Superseedr normalizes both forms.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection or Disk issues?**
- Check your firewall allows outbound connections
- Increase file descriptor limit: `ulimit -n 65536`
- For VPN users: Verify Gluetun is running and connected

**Slow downloads?**
- Enable port forwarding in your VPN settings
- Check the swarm health in the TUI's analytics view

## 🐳 Running with Docker

Superseedr offers a fully secured Docker setup using Gluetun. All BitTorrent traffic is routed through a VPN tunnel with dynamic port forwarding and zero manual network configuration.

If you want privacy and simplicity, Docker is the recommended way to run Superseedr.

Follow steps below to create .env and .gluetun.env files to configure OpenVPN or WireGuard.

```bash
# Docker (No VPN):
# Uses internal container storage. Data persists until the container is removed.
docker run -it jagatranvo/superseedr:latest

# Docker Compose (Gluetun with your VPN):
# Requires .env and .gluetun.env configuration (see below).
docker compose up -d && docker compose attach superseedr
```

### Setup

1.  **Get the Docker configuration files:**
    You only need the Docker-related files to run the pre-built image, not the full source code.

    **Option A: Clone the repository (Simple)**
    This gets you everything, including the source code.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jagalite/superseedr.git
    cd superseedr
    ```
    
    **Option B: Download only the necessary files (Minimal)**
    This is ideal if you just want to run the Docker image.
    ```bash
    mkdir superseedr
    cd superseedr

    # Download the compose file and example config files
    curl -sL \
      -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagalite/superseedr/main/docker-compose.yml \
      -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagalite/superseedr/main/.env.example \
      -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagalite/superseedr/main/.gluetun.env.example

    # Note the example files might be hidden run the commands below to make a copy.
    cp .env.example .env
    cp .gluetun.env.example .gluetun.env
    ```

2.  **Recommended: Create your environment files:**
    * **App Paths & Build Choice:** Edit your `.env` file from the example. This file controls your data paths and which build to use.
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        Edit `.env` to set your absolute host paths (e.g., `HOST_SUPERSEEDR_ROOT_PATH=/my/path/seedbox`). **This is important:** it maps the container's shared seedbox root (`/seedbox`) to a real folder on your computer. Keep `superseedr-config/` inside that root for the simplest shared-config setup.

    * **VPN Config:** Edit your `.gluetun.env` file from the example.
        ```bash
        cp .gluetun.env.example .gluetun.env
        ```
        Edit `.gluetun.env` with your VPN provider, credentials, and server region.

#### Option 1: VPN with Gluetun (Recommended)

Gluetun provides:
- A VPN kill-switch
- Automatic port forwarding
- Dynamic port changes from your VPN provider

Many VPN providers frequently assign new inbound ports. Most BitTorrent clients must be restarted when this port changes, breaking connectability and slowing downloads.
Superseedr can detect Gluetun’s updated port and reload the listener **live**, without a restart, preserving swarm performance.

1.  Make sure you have created and configured your `.gluetun.env` file.
2.  Run the stack using the default `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose attach superseedr
```
> To detach from the TUI without stopping the container, use the Docker key sequence: `Ctrl+P` followed by `Ctrl+Q`.
> **Optional:** press `[z]` first to enter power-saving mode.

---

#### Option 2: Direct docker run

This runs the client directly without Gluetun. It is useful for advanced users who want to manage networking themselves.

    docker run --rm -it \
      -e SUPERSEEDR_DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=/seedbox \
      -e SUPERSEEDR_SHARED_CONFIG_DIR=/seedbox/superseedr-config \
      -e SUPERSEEDR_HOST_ID=seedbox-docker \
      -p 6881:6881/tcp \
      -p 6881:6881/udp \
      -v /your/seedbox:/seedbox \
      -v ./docker-data/share:/root/.local/share/jagalite.superseedr \
      jagatranvo/superseedr:latest

Replace /your/seedbox with the shared seedbox root on your host.
Keep superseedr-config/ inside that folder so the container sees it at /seedbox/superseedr-config.

## 🔗 Integrations & Automation

Superseedr includes several integration points designed for automation, headless operation, and easy pairing with VPN containers like Gluetun.
For dockerized interoperability tests, see `docs/integration-harness.md`.

Check out the [Superseedr Plugins Repository](https://github.com/Jagalite/superseedr-plugins) for plugins (beta testing).

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand automation details</strong></summary>

### 1. File Watcher & Auto-Ingest
The application automatically watches configured directories for new content. You can drop files into your watch folder to trigger actions immediately.

| File Type | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`.torrent`** | Automatically adds the torrent and begins downloading. |
| **`.magnet`** | A text file containing a magnet link. Adds the magnet download. |
| **`.path`** | A text file containing a local absolute path to a `.torrent` file. |
| **`shutdown.cmd`** | If a file named `shutdown.cmd` appears, the client will initiate a graceful shutdown. |

### 2. CLI Control
You can control the running daemon using the built-in CLI commands. These commands write to the watch folder, allowing you to control the app from scripts or other containers.

```bash
# Add a magnet link
superseedr add "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."

# Add a torrent file by path
superseedr add "/path/to/linux.iso.torrent"

# Persist shared launcher config for installed/protocol launches
superseedr set-shared-config "/path/to/seedbox"

# Persist a launcher host id for shared mode
superseedr set-host-id "desktop-a"

# Inspect the effective shared launcher config
superseedr show-shared-config
superseedr show-host-id

# Convert local config into layered shared config
superseedr to-shared "/path/to/seedbox"

# Convert the active shared config back into local standalone config
superseedr to-standalone

# Stop the client gracefully
superseedr stop-client
```

### 3. Status API & Monitoring
For external monitoring dashboards or health checks, Superseedr periodically dumps its full internal state to a JSON file.

* **Output Location:** `status_files/app_state.json` (inside your data directory).
* **Content:** Contains CPU/RAM usage, total transfer stats, and detailed metrics for every active torrent.

#### Configuration
You can control how often this file is updated using the `output_status_interval` setting.

**Environment Variable:**
Set this variable in your Docker config to change the update frequency (in seconds).
```bash
# Update the status file every 5 seconds
SUPERSEEDR_OUTPUT_STATUS_INTERVAL=5
```

### 4. RSS History Retention
RSS download history is persisted for deduplication and UI metadata, but it is capped at **1000 entries**.

* When the history grows past 1000, the **oldest entries are pruned** first.
* This limit applies to persisted runtime history in `persistence/rss.toml`.

## 🧠 Advanced: Architecture & Engineering

Superseedr is built on a **Reactive Actor** architecture verified by model-based fuzzing, ensuring stability under chaos. It features a **Self-Tuning Resource Allocator** that adapts to your hardware in real-time and a hybrid **BitTorrent v2** engine, all powered by asynchronous **Tokio** streams for maximum throughput.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand technical internals</strong></summary>

This section is designed for developers, contributors, and AI agents seeking to understand the internal design decisions that drive Superseedr's performance.

### ⚡ Async Networking Core
Superseedr is built on the **Tokio** runtime, leveraging asynchronous I/O for maximum concurrency.
* **Full-Duplex Streams:** Every peer connection is split into independent **Reader** and **Writer** tasks (`tokio::io::split`). This allows the client to saturate download and upload bandwidth simultaneously without thread blocking or lock contention, ensuring the UI remains responsive even with thousands of active connections.
* **Actor-Based Session Management:** Each peer operates as an isolated Actor. Communication between the network socket and the core logic happens exclusively via `mpsc` channels, meaning a slow or misbehaving peer cannot block the main event loop or affect other connections.
* **Hot-Swappable Listeners:** The application runs an async file watcher (`notify`) on the VPN configuration volume. When **Gluetun** rotates the forwarded port, Superseedr detects the file change and instantly rebinds the TCP listener to the new port without dropping the swarm state or restarting the process.

### 🔒 Security & Privacy Engineering
* **VPN Isolation (Kill-Switch):** In the Docker Compose setup, Superseedr's network stack is fully routed through **Gluetun**. This guarantees that 100% of BitTorrent traffic traverses the VPN tunnel. If the tunnel drops, connectivity is cut immediately, preventing any IP leakage over the host connection.
* **Binary-Level Private Mode:** Private tracker compliance is enforced at compile time, not just runtime. By building with `--no-default-features`, the DHT and Peer Exchange (PEX) modules are completely excluded from the binary, guaranteeing zero leakage of private swarms.

### 🏗️ Reactive Actor Model & Verification
The application logic abandons traditional mutex-heavy threading in favor of a **Functional Reactive** architecture.
* **Deterministic State Machine:** The `TorrentManager` operates as a Finite State Machine (FSM). External events (Network I/O, Timer Ticks) are transmuted into `Action` enums, processed purely in memory, and result in a list of `Effects`.
* **Chaos Engineering:** We validate this core logic using **Model-Based Fuzzing** (via Proptest). Our test suite injects deterministic faults to verify correctness under hostile conditions:
* **Network Chaos:** Simulates **Packet Loss** (dropped actions), **High Latency** (reordered actions), and **Duplication** (ghost packets).
* **Malicious Peers:** Fuzzers act as "Bad Actors" that send protocol violations, infinite byte-streams, and out-of-bounds requests to ensure the engine punishes them without crashing.

### 🤖 Self-Tuning Resource Allocator
Instead of static `ulimit` values, Superseedr runs a **Stochastic Hill Climbing** optimizer in the background.
* **The Loop:** Every 90 seconds, it randomly reallocates internal permits between competing resources—**Peer Sockets**, **Disk Read Slots**, and **Disk Write Slots**—to find the local maximum for performance.
* **Universal Optimization:** This algorithm dynamically discovers the optimal configuration for *any* combination of hardware (SSD vs HDD) and network environment (Home Fiber vs Datacenter), automatically scaling concurrency to match capacity.

### 📡 Integrity Prober
Superseedr automatically and continuously checks completed torrents in the background without falling back to blunt full-library rescans.
* **Designed for Scale:** Integrity work is split into small bounded batches, keeping checks cheap even across very large collections.
* **Fast Fault Detection:** Foreground disk-read failures immediately trigger targeted recovery reprobes, surfacing missing or damaged data quickly.
* **No-Config Recovery:** Healthy torrents are monitored automatically, while unavailable torrents are prioritized for fast recovery detection without extra setup.

### 🧮 Statistical Engine
Superseedr calculates granular metrics in real-time to drive optimization and observability:
* **IOPS & Latency:** Tracks instantaneous Input/Output Operations Per Second and uses an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to calculate precise Read/Write latency (ms). This helps distinguish between bandwidth limits and disk saturation.
* **Disk Thrash Score:** Measures physical disk head movement using `Sum(|Offset - PrevOffset|) / Ops`. This detects random I/O bottlenecks that raw speed metrics miss.
* **Seek Cost per Byte (SCPB):** Calculates the "expense" of I/O relative to throughput (`TotalSeekDistance / TotalBytes`), serving as the primary penalty factor for the self-tuner.

### ♟️ Protocol Algorithms
Superseedr implements optimized versions of the core BitTorrent exchange strategies:
* **Selective & Priority Downloading:** Support for file-level priority (Skip, Normal, High). The engine maps file boundaries to pieces, prioritizing high-value data while ensuring shared boundary pieces are handled correctly to prevent corruption.
* **Rarest-First Piece Selection:** The client continuously tracks piece availability across the swarm, prioritizing rare pieces to prevent "swarm starvation" and ensure redundant availability.
* **Tit-for-Tat Choking:** The choking algorithm uses a robust Tit-for-Tat strategy (reciprocation), rewarding peers who provide the highest bandwidth while optimistically unchoking new peers to discover better connections.

### 🔬 Unique Visualizations & UX
Superseedr includes specialized TUI components (`src/tui/view.rs`) to visualize data usually hidden by other clients:
* **Integrated File Explorer:** A custom, navigable filesystem browser that provides instant previewing of `.torrent` file contents and internal directory structures before the download begins.
* **Block Particle Stream:** A vertical "Matrix-style" flow visualizing individual 16KB data blocks entering (Blue) or leaving (Green).
* **Peer Lifecycle Scatterplot:** Tracks the exact moment peers are Discovered, Connected, and Disconnected to visually diagnose swarm "churn."
* **Backpressure Markers:** The network graph overlays red "Backpressure Events" whenever the self-tuner detects a system limit (e.g., file descriptors), proving the engine is actively managing load.

### 🧬 Hybrid BitTorrent v2 (BEP 52)
Superseedr implements the full **Merkle Tree** verification stack required for BitTorrent v2.
* **Block-Level Validation:** Incoming data is hashed and verified at the 16KiB block level using Merkle Proofs, allowing for the immediate rejection of corrupt data before it is written to disk.
* **Hybrid Swarms:** The client handles `VerifyPieceV2` effects to simultaneously handshake with legacy v1 peers (SHA-1) and modern v2 peers (SHA-256).

### 🛡️ Backpressure & Flow Control
* **Persistent Retries with Backoff:** Critical I/O operations (like disk writes) are protected by an exponential backoff retry mechanism (jittered), ensuring transient system locks or busy disks don't crash the download session.
* **Adaptive Pipelining:** The `PeerSession` uses a dynamic sliding window (AIMD-like algorithm) that expands or shrinks the request queue based on the peer's real-time response rate (`blocks_received_interval`), maximizing link saturation.
* **Token Buckets:** Global bandwidth is shaped via a hierarchical Token Bucket algorithm that enforces rate limits without blocking async executors.

### 📜 Key Standards Compliance
Superseedr implements the following BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals (BEPs):
* **BEP 3:** The BitTorrent Protocol Specification
* **BEP 5:** DHT Protocol (Mainline)
* **BEP 9:** Extension for Peers to Send Metadata Files (Magnet Links)
* **BEP 10:** Extension Protocol
* **BEP 11:** Peer Exchange (PEX)
* **BEP 19:** WebSeed - HTTP/FTP Seeding
* **BEP 52:** The BitTorrent Protocol v2
