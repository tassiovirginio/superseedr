# Roadmap
This document is a high-level guide to the direction of superseedr.
It is intentionally stable but flexible as implementation details evolve.
For specific tracking, use repository issues and labels.

## Status Baseline (from changelog)
The roadmap now reflects features shipped through `v1.0.1`.

### Shipped
- `v1.0.0`: Integrated RSS workspace, advanced RSS filtering, and safer high-impact confirmation flows.
- `v1.0.1`: RSS duplicate-filter guardrails and follow-up RSS UX/readability fixes.
- `v0.9.38`: Semantic theme system, new built-in themes, theme cycling, and broader theme effects.
- `v0.9.29` to `v0.9.38`: Major TUI architecture and layout/table behavior refactors, including smarter column visibility behavior.
- `v0.9.30`: BitTorrent v2/hybrid support, merkle verification, and related integration test coverage.
- `v0.9.35`: JSON state dump/export foundation for external integrations.
- `v0.9.36`: Peer activity visualization redesign improvements.

## Big Features
- `[Shipped]` **RSS Feed Support**
- `[Planned]` **Config Screen Redesign**: Modernize and refactor config management for more complex user inputs.
- `[Planned]` **Advanced Torrent Management**: Add multi-select, bulk actions, and grouping in torrent management UI flows.

- `[Partially Shipped]` **Alternative and Custom Themes**: Extend beyond built-ins with full user-defined theme packs.
- `[Shipped]` **Internal TUI Architecture Refactor**
- `[Planned]` **Persistent Data Across Sessions**: Persist peer/system history and support reputation/blocking logic.
- `[Partially Shipped]` **Scriptability and CLI Enhancements**: Build on JSON status export with richer control surfaces.
- `[Planned]` **Log Levels and TUI**: Runtime log level controls and in-app log viewer.
- `[Planned]` **User Configurable Layouts**: Saveable/reconfigurable layouts.
- `[Partially Shipped]` **Peer Stream Redesign**: Continue expanding stream visual encoding and controls.
- `[Planned]` **Fully Asynchronous Validation**: Complete non-blocking validation/revalidation pipeline work.
- `[Planned]` **Peer Churn Overload Management**: Harden behavior for very large swarms and peer churn.
- `[Partially Shipped]` **Integration Testing**: Continue scaling interop coverage and CI automation.

## Roadmap to v1.5
`v1.0` shipped core usability and stability milestones.
The `v1.1` to `v1.5` window focuses on finishing advanced UX and operator controls on top of the current baseline.

Priority themes:
- Advanced torrent management workflows (multi-select, bulk actions, grouping/tagging).
- Config UX overhaul (structured inputs, validation, grouped sections).
- Logging observability inside TUI (log widget and runtime verbosity controls).
- Validation pipeline hardening (async/revalidation progress and resilience).
- Expanded interop testing depth and CI confidence gates.

## Future (v2.0+)
Longer-term work targets deeper networking and operational control:
- Persistent long-term stats, peer reputation, and auto-blocking.
- Headless/scriptable control surface and richer CLI automation.
- User-configurable/saved TUI layouts.
- High-churn peer management at large scale.
- Networking parity/features (uTP, IPv6, UPnP, hole punch, DHT search).

# Detailed Roadmap Steps

## Phase: 1.1 to v1.5
