# Changelog

## Release v1.0.0
### 🚀 New Features
- **Integrated RSS Workspace**: Added a full RSS experience in-app, including feed management, preview browsing, and streamlined ingest so you can discover and add downloads without leaving the terminal.
- **Advanced RSS Filtering**: Added richer filter modes and smarter match handling so you can surface relevant feed items faster and reduce manual triage.
- **Safer High-Impact Actions**: Added stronger confirmation flows (including Shift+Y confirmation paths) to reduce accidental destructive actions during everyday use.

### ✨ Improvements
- **Magnet Name Resolution**: Magnet entries now resolve display names more reliably from link metadata, making startup and history views clearer.
- **UI Flow Consistency**: Screen transitions, search behavior, and key routing are more predictable across browser, normal, and help flows for smoother navigation.
- **Persistence Robustness**: Torrent metadata persistence is now more durable across restart scenarios, with safer file finalization behavior on platform-specific edge cases.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **DHT Recovery Handling**: Fixed DHT rebind/bootstrap warning handling and added automatic recovery retries so temporary bootstrap failures are less disruptive.
- **Progress Accuracy with Skipped Files**: Fixed completion/progress display for torrents with skipped files to avoid misleading partial-progress states.
- **RSS Network Safety Edge Cases**: Fixed RSS URL safety handling for localhost/private-network edge cases (including IPv6-localhost parsing) and improved stale RSS error cleanup.

## Release v0.9.39
### 🚀 New Features
- **Boundary-Aware Piece Scheduling**: Added a piece-local request path that correctly handles torrents where piece sizes are not aligned to 16 KiB blocks, improving reliability on edge-case torrent layouts.

### ✨ Improvements
- **Smarter Download Request Routing**: Request and cancel generation now use piece-local block tuples, making peer work assignment more consistent after resume/restart and during multi-peer scheduling.
- **More Predictable Completion Flow**: Piece/block coordination is now cleaner in non-aligned layouts, reducing false “in-flight but no progress” behavior under heavy swarm traffic.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Non-Aligned Torrent Stalls**: Fixed a bug where downloads could appear active but stop advancing because needed boundary blocks were incorrectly suppressed.
- **Piece Boundary Handling**: Fixed edge cases where adjacent pieces sharing a global block slot could interfere with each other’s progress.
- **Resume Verification Consistency**: Improved restart/resume behavior so verified progress and subsequent block requests stay aligned with actual missing data.

## Release v0.9.38
### 🚀 New Features
- **Richer Built-In Theme System**: Added a semantic theme engine plus multiple new themes (including Neon and Candy Land Pink) for deeper, more consistent UI personalization.
- **One-Key Theme Cycling**: You can now switch themes instantly from the keyboard, without leaving your workflow.
- **Global Theme Effects**: Visual effects now apply across more of the interface, including swarm and stream styling, for a more cohesive live UI experience.

### ✨ Improvements
- **Smarter Footer Readability**: Footer and command hints now fit terminal width more intelligently, with cleaner truncation and stable theme/effects labels.
- **More Reliable Table Navigation**: Torrent/peer column visibility, sorting, and header navigation are now synchronized for predictable behavior in dynamic layouts.
- **Higher Peer Capacity and Clearer Status**: Connection admission limits were raised and activity messaging was improved, helping large swarms stay clearer and more stable.
- **More Flexible Rate Shortcuts**: Data-rate controls now accept both `[`/`]` and `{`/`}` for easier use across keyboard layouts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Skip-Hashing Validation Accuracy**: Skip-hashing no longer marks torrents as validated when required files are missing or incomplete on disk.
- **Validation State Correctness**: Metadata-transition edge cases now preserve prior valid state correctly and downgrade it when completion regresses.
- **Theme and Layout Sync Fixes**: Fixed cases where theme/config sync and hidden-column handling could drift, plus footer cutoff issues on narrower screens.

## Release v0.9.37

- **Version bump:** fixing github with new macOS flow.

## Release v0.9.36

### 🚀 New Features
- **Smart First-Run Setup**: On first launch, the app now automatically detects your system's Downloads folder and configures it as the default download location—no manual setup required.
- **Intelligent Welcome Screen**: The welcome screen now only appears for truly new users and automatically dismisses when you add your first torrent.

### ✨ Improvements
- **Enhanced Peer Activity Visualization**: Redesigned the peer stream display with improved visual density—Braille-style dots for light activity and emphasized markers for heavy peer connections, making it easier to spot swarm health at a glance.
- **Watch Path Visibility**: The configured watch folder path is now displayed in the interface for better transparency.
- **Smart Progress Column**: The progress column in the torrent list will only show when torrents are downloading to validating.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
