# Changelog

## Release v0.9.36

### 🚀 New Features
- **Smart First-Run Setup**: On first launch, the app now automatically detects your system's Downloads folder and configures it as the default download location—no manual setup required.
- **Intelligent Welcome Screen**: The welcome screen now only appears for truly new users and automatically dismisses when you add your first torrent.

### ✨ Improvements
- **Enhanced Peer Activity Visualization**: Redesigned the peer stream display with improved visual density—Braille-style dots for light activity and emphasized markers for heavy peer connections, making it easier to spot swarm health at a glance.
- **Watch Path Visibility**: The configured watch folder path is now displayed in the interface for better transparency.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- None in this release.

## Release v0.9.35
### Performance
- Added periodic application state dump to JSON for external monitoring/integrations.
- Configured rolling file appender for logs with daily rotation and 31-day retention.

### Refactoring
- Modularized integration logic into a new `src/integrations/` directory.
- Decoupled CLI argument parsing and input processing into `src/integrations/cli.rs`.
- Externalized file system watching and folder scanning logic into `src/integrations/watcher.rs`.
- Centralized application status serialization and export in `src/integrations/status.rs`.
- Simplified `App` struct by delegating file event handling and watch folder scanning to the integrations module.

### Testing
- Added unit tests for CLI input processing, including magnet link and path file handling.
- Added unit tests for file watcher logic and command mapping.
- Added serialization tests for the new JSON status dump feature.

## Release v0.9.34
### Performance
- Dynamically hide download/upload speed columns when no activity detected

### Refactoring
- Added `container_name` field to torrent configuration for explicit folder control
- Implemented intelligent container naming: auto-generates folders with info_hash suffix for multi-file torrents
- Added support for explicit "no folder" option to flatten multi-file torrents to single directory

### Testing
- Added unit test for container logic with explicit empty folder selection
### Performance
- Implemented dynamic framerate control based on app mode (60 FPS for Welcome screen, 1 FPS for Power Saving mode, user-defined otherwise)

### Refactoring
- Changed quit key binding from lowercase 'q' to uppercase 'Q' to prevent accidental quits
- Added text sanitization for torrent names and paths to handle control characters gracefully

### Testing

## Release v0.9.32
### Refactoring
- Moved file watcher to App struct for dynamic reconfiguration during runtime.
- Updated GitHub Actions to latest versions (checkout@v6, cache@v5).

### Performance
- Updated dependencies for improved performance and stability.

### Testing
- Updated proptest cases for nightly fuzzing.

## Release v0.9.31
### Performance
- Optimized file allocation by skipping padding and skipped files.
- Added fast-path detection for fresh downloads vs partial resumes.

### Refactoring
- Introduced file priority system (Normal, High, Skip) for per-file download control.
- Implemented tree-based file browser with preview for download location selection.
- Added settings backup system with timestamped archives.
- Changed download path from required to optional, deferring selection until metadata loads.
- Renamed `DhtTorrent` to `MetadataTorrent` for clarity.
- Refactored `download_dir` to `torrent_data_path` across torrent management.

### Testing
- Added tree navigation tests for the new file browser.
- Added storage tests for skipped file handling.

## Release v0.9.30
### Performance
- Optimized BitTorrent v2 verification with small-file root lookup bypassing.
- Implemented memory-aware cleanup logic for v2 pending data buffers.
- Improved piece request pipelining with deterministic rarity-first selection.

### Refactoring
- Introduced BitTorrent v2 and Hybrid torrent support (BEP 52).
- Implemented Merkle tree verification engine for v2 data integrity.
- Refactored torrent parser to handle v2 file trees and synthetic padding files (BEP 47).
- Decoupled piece geometry from contiguous streams to support file-aligned pieces.
- Enhanced TUI with an "Add Torrent" file picker and improved watch folder management.

### Testing
- Added comprehensive v2/hybrid integration tests covering boundary alignment and proof verification.
- Introduced scale tests for 1000-piece torrents to verify pipeline stability.
- Added proptest-based network fault injection for the state machine.

## Release v0.9.29
### Performance
- Introduced "Smart Table" logic to dynamically hide columns based on priority and width.
- Optimized TUI event listener to use non-blocking polls for better shutdown responsiveness.

### Refactoring
- Major TUI refactor: decoupled layout calculation from rendering logic.
- Modularized TUI components into `src/tui/` directory.
- Introduced `LayoutContext` and `LayoutPlan` for structured UI management.

### Testing
- Added unit tests for new TUI navigation logic.
- Enhanced `Settings` parsing tests with comprehensive coverage.

## Release v0.9.28
### Performance
- Implemented a dynamic request window size in `PeerSession` to improve download throughput.
- Optimized `TokenBucket` to reduce lock contention for unlimited rates.
- Improved network writer performance by batching messages to reduce syscalls.

### Refactoring
- Replaced single block requests with a `BulkRequest` system for better pipelining.
- Updated `web_seed_worker` to use the new bulk request system.
- Refactored `TorrentManager` and its state machine to support bulk commands.

### Testing
- Added extensive tests for the new dynamic window sizing logic in `PeerSession`.
- Added a proptest regression file to save and re-run failure cases.


## Release v0.9.27
### Features
- Added block manager to improve download performance.

### Bug Fixes
- Updated torrent sorting weight for better prioritization.
- Added more tests and fixed tolerance issues.

### Refactoring
- Consolidated and adjusted TUI components.
- Added testing and integration via composition.

### Performance
- Increased in-flight request limits for better throughput.


## Release v0.9.26
### Features
- **Advanced Networking**: Implemented `web-seed-workers` for improved seeding, and an "effect pattern" for more resilient network communication. Added network simulations for robust testing.
- **Core Refactoring**: Major refactoring of the codebase for better performance and maintainability, including the implementation of a resource manager and an adaptive seek penalty.
### Bugs
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Introduced a wide range of testing strategies, including chaos engineering, fuzz testing, and state machine-based tests to ensure stability and reliability.

## Initial Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Added robust support for major operating systems, including Windows (Wix installer), macOS (notarized builds), and Linux (MUSL builds).
- **Dynamic TUI**: Overhauled the Text User Interface (TUI) with new features like a swarm heatmap, peer activity lanes, and dynamic resizing, providing a more informative and user-friendly experience.
- **Docker Integration**: Full Docker support with examples for docker-compose, multi-architecture builds (ARM), and integrated VPN (Gluetun) support for enhanced privacy.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Established a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and releases.
